The CIS Department serves as the clinical liaison between IT Services and UW Medicine, and supports clinical use of the Electronic Health Record. The Electronic Health Record is composed of many applications -- Cerner Millennium and Epic are the major documentation applications. These two applications are the major focus of CIS support.  When planned or unplanned downtimes interrupt or disrupt use of the EHR, patient care must safely continue (Business Continuity). After the EHR is restored to regular functioning, EHR work must be done to capture the care that occurred during the downtime (Business Resumption). Because of the significant interdependence of clinical care and the EHR, and the need to actively prepare for and manage downtimes, downtimes are considered high risk events. From a CIS department perspective, departmental disaster preparedness is also essential.

This role will heavily interface with IT-facing BC/DR work.

The two applications have a complex set of multi-disciplinary clinical and administrative workflows that must be managed prior to, during, and post downtime for both planned and unplanned downtime events. Significant EHR (electronic health record) or network downtimes are so impactful that they can trigger a Medical Centers Disaster Response, with command center structures activation. The complexity of the integration of the application and clinician workflow, is also mirrored by the Clinical Applications Programs multiple resource teams, some or all of which may be involved in any given downtime.  CIS Operations and Support BC/DR functions will be performed in partnership with the medical centers, UWNCs, School of Medicine (Residency Programs), and IT Services.
